The LCDPane.java code in this directory was contributed by Alexander Avtanski
and is part of a LCD Screenshot Generator which he wrote and made publicly
available at,

  http://avtanski.net/projects/lcd/

If you are looking for a general purpose tool to generate LCD screenshots,
see the above webpage.  The generator can produce simulated displays of
many sizes and colors.  The generator can be downloaded and run on a local
computer or embedded in web pages as an applet.
